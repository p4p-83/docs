## A pick-and-place for rapid prototyping

Existing pick-and-place machines are wholly impractical for rapid prototyping. This project aims to implement a computer vision-augmented, zero-setup pick-and-place designed *for* prototyping. The goal of such a machine is to empower hardware engineers to prototype efficiently with a wider range of electronic components than they may otherwise be capable of without machine assistance.

### The research question

*How could computer vision be employed to augment the design of a zero-setup pick-and-place machine tailored for rapid prototyping?*
