# LitePlacer

The [LitePlacer](https://liteplacer.com/) is a low-cost pick-and-place machine aimed for prototyping, which supports down to `0402` passives, has thorough assembly and operation documentation available, has vision with two cameras, and has open-source [[OpenPnP]]-compatible software.

The [LitePlacer store](https://www.liteplacer.com/shop20/) contains the [LitePlacer standard kit](https://www.liteplacer.com/shop20/index.php?route=product/product&path=59&product_id=64), which would provide a solution for our:
- [[Gantry System]]
- [[Vacuum Head]]
- [[Vacuum Nozzles]]
- [[Cameras]]
- [[Controller]]

This would be useful, but is likely to be *too much* of an off-the-shelf solution.
