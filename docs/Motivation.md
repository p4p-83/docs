## The user interface perspective

Automation usually comes in two flavours: complete automation or none at all. It’s relatively straightforward to automate repetitive and predictable tasks. In such cases, deciding to automate is a simple decision made by considering the effort required to program a computer and comparing this with the ongoing effort needed to perform the task.

This isn’t so in jobs where a human’s judgement or creativity is necessary, and where each situation encountered calls for a wildly different action to the last. In such cases humans are usually left to their own devices and may be made to struggle through the task physically while their brains think about it, simply because no better way has been conceived.

This project aims to bridge this gap by researching the cost-benefit analysis of a semi-automatic, computer-assisted device that helps humans with a task that requires both considerable skill and much careful dexterity: prototyping small runs of printed circuit boards (PCBs).

## The pick & place perspective

Currently, an R&D engineer has two realistic choices when it comes to surface mount PCB assembly. They can assemble entirely by hand; for this they might use a soldering iron, or they might use solder paste, a stencil, and a reflow oven. Either way there will be a lot of painstaking tweezer-work. Alternatively, the engineer could run the boards on some kind of assembly line using a pick and place machine.

Assembling boards by hand is the preferred option for small runs. It’s only when the number of boards increases that the rapidity of a pick and place machine justifies the setup cost. This project would aim to rebalance these times.

The ideal pick-and-place for prototyping would have no setup time but still provide some mechanical and computer assistance. This could improve productivity at the same time as reducing eye and back strain.

## The question

What we need is an efficient way to let an engineer operate such a machine with minimal fuss. This demands a very seamless user interface — one that has almost video game–like intractability. That's what we aim to investigate in this project.
