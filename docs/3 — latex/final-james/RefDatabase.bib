  abstract   = {The literature on information visualization establishes the usability of interfaces with an overview of the information space, but for zoomable user interfaces, results are mixed. We compare zoomable user interfaces with and without an overview to understand the navigation patterns and usability of these interfaces. Thirty-two subjects solved navigation and browsing tasks on two maps. We found no difference between interfaces in subjects' ability to solve tasks correctly. Eighty percent of the subjects preferred the interface with an overview, stating that it supported navigation and helped keep track of their position on the map. However, subjects were faster with the interface without an overview when using one of the two maps. We conjecture that this difference was due to the organization of that map in multiple levels, which rendered the overview unnecessary by providing richer navigation cues through semantic zooming. The combination of that map and the interface without an overview also improved subjects' recall of objects on the map. Subjects who switched between the overview and the detail windows used more time, suggesting that integration of overview and detail windows adds complexity and requires additional mental and motor effort.},

SMDs are widely used to improve production efficiency and reduce common defects. However, these machines are quite expensive and not easily available for the local market. This study is based on the design of a P\&P machine model that incorporates principles of machine learning theory. The model has been developed in such a way that it can be introduced to the local market in a more cost-effective manner without compromising on its precision and accuracy.},

  abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to optimize assembly processes in order to minimize defects in the assembly of 01005 chip components. Design/methodology/approach - During the study, solder paste printing process-related variables, such as solder paste type, stencil type, and stencil opening ratio, and pick and place process-related methods, such as vision camera type and vacuum pickup nozzle type were evaluated with the goal of achieving a high-yield assembly solution for 01005 chip components. A test board was used in a series of designed experiments to optimize the solder paste printing, pick and placement, and reflow processes. Assembly defects were analyzed as a function of the stencil design and the assembly processes. Findings - The results of the study indicated that both electroformed and electropolished laser-cut stencils had a comparable print quality with respect to the solder volume delivered to the pads. In terms of assembly yield performance, type 4 (size range: 20-38 μm) solder paste with a smaller sphere size gave a better overall yield and better paste deposition on the pad, if used on a 0.08-mm thick electroformed stencil with a 90 per cent aperture. Temperature cycling between -65 and 150°C, with up to 1,500 cycles, showed that no cracks were observed at the solder joints due to temperature cycling. The process and design change required for achieving a robust manufacturing process have been indicated and reported. Originality/value - The results of this work provide process recommendations for the implementation of 01005-sized chip components assembly in mass production processes.},

An adaptation law is developed such that the robot is able to adjust its own role according to the human's intention to lead or follow, which is inferred through the measured interaction force. In the absence of human interaction forces, the adaptive scheme allows the robot to take the lead and complete the task by itself. On the other hand, when the human persistently exerts strong forces that signal an unambiguous intent to lead, the robot yields and becomes the follower. Additionally, the full spectrum of mixed roles between these extreme scenarios is afforded by continuous online update of the control that is shared between both agents. Theoretical analysis shows that the resulting shared control is optimal with respect to a two-agent coordination game. Experimental results illustrate better overall performance, in terms of both error and effort, compared with fixed-role interactions.},

  abstract = {The typical centralized cloud model is poorly suited to latency-sensitive applications requiring low-latency and high-throughput. This paper proposes an integrity-preserving serverless framework for live-video streaming that runs on the edge of the network. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel P2P service based on WebRTC (web browsers with Real-Time Communications) called MioStream. MioStream is an open-source alternative for distributed media streaming that runs on the edge of the network without incurring in costly and extensive CDN infrastructure. We contribute a unique mix of algorithms using WebRTC data channels. For instance, under network degradation and high-churn environments, MioStream restructures the topology dynamically. MioStream provides authentication, privacy, and integrity of video chunks. This paper exposes a set of micro-benchmarks to measure the quality of service under network degradation and high churn environment (inducing failures). The Mesh topology offers the highest goodput per peer; the stalled playback on a node equals 1.8% of the total video play. Our results show the feasibility of this proof of concept under high-churn environments. The total stream interruptions in the topology are not longer than one second under a binomial distributed series of failures. The integrity check applied to each package includes a considerable overhead and impact the quality of service.},

  abstract = {Computer Numeric Control (CNC) is a significant pillar of manufacturing for decades. These systems are an essential part of future manufacturing. In the urge towards the development of next-generation manufacturing systems, various technologies have been introduced. Moreover, based on those technologies, numerous systems have been developed all around the world. In order to assist in future research, the related major technologies and developments are discussed in this content. This paper presents the review of basics CN), Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Computer-Aided Process Planning (CAPP), Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), G codes (ISO 6983), Standard for the Exchange of Product (STEP) model data (STEP), STEP-numeric control (STEP-NC), and open architecture control (OAC) technologies. The in-depth discussion on the development and implementation of the STEP and STEP-NC technologies is also addressed. The review also highlights the benefits and role of the open architecture control technology in the CNC system development. Apart from that, the paper also presents the last 17 years of embedded CNC systems development in tabular form, which shows the cocktail of various technologies and ISO data interface models. Finally, the paper concludes with future directions and recommendations.},

  abstract = {In shared control teleoperation, the robot assists the user in accomplishing the desired task, making teleoperation easier and more seamless. Rather than simply executing the user's input, which is hindered by the inadequacies of the interface, the robot attempts to predict the user's intent, and assists in accomplishing it. In this work, we are interested in the scientific underpinnings of assistance: we propose an intuitive formalism that captures assistance as policy blending, illustrate how some of the existing techniques for shared control instantiate it, and provide a principled analysis of its main components: prediction of user intent and its arbitration with the user input. We define the prediction problem, with foundations in inverse reinforcement learning, discuss simplifying assumptions that make it tractable, and test these on data from users teleoperating a robotic manipulator. We define the arbitration problem from a control-theoretic perspective, and turn our attention to what users consider good arbitration. We conduct a user study that analyzes the effect of different factors on the performance of assistance, indicating that arbitration should be contextual: it should depend on the robot's confidence in itself and in the user, and even the particulars of the user. Based on the study, we discuss challenges and opportunities that a robot sharing the control with the user might face: adaptation to the context and the user, legibility of behavior, and the closed loop between prediction and user behavior.}

  abstract  = { The current study sought to investigate an empirical exploration of the flow engagement concept through videogame play between experts and novices. Eighty participants engaged in various levels of the videogame Super Mario Bros. Twenty experts and twenty novices experienced the easier level of World 1-2 while the other twenty experts and novices were exposed to the more difficult level World 6-1. After gameplay, participants completed a modified survey measuring flow. This survey, along with overall percentage game score, was analyzed. A significant interaction was found between game level (challenge level) and skill levels in perceived flow, with significant main effects for expertise in perceived skill, for game level (challenge level) in perceived challenge, and for game level (challenge level) in overall percentage score. These findings are relevant for understanding videogame flow in videogames of varying degrees of challenge and in players of different expertise levels. Discussion on these findings highlights the purpose of this paper. }
