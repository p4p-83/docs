# LumenPnP

Similar to the [[LitePlacer]], the [LumenPnP](https://www.opulo.io/products/lumenpnp) is another open-source pick-and-place machine from which we can purchase individual parts.

This one is particularly interesting as the [[Gantry System]] is only available if you buy the full kit, but you can individually purchase:

- [Toolhead Assembly](https://www.opulo.io/products/wired-toolhead-assembly) and [Vacuum Pump and Valve](https://www.opulo.io/products/vacuum-pump-and-valve-set) for our [[Vacuum Head]].
