## With C code

Some discussion of options <https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=174098>

V4L2 library is one option <https://www.linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis-old/v4l2grab-example.html>

<https://github.com/philips/libv4l/tree/master>

RPi seems to recommend libcamera and use this underneath some of their newer tools.

Using libcamera is documented on their repo <https://github.com/raspberrypi/libcamera/blob/main/Documentation/guides/application-developer.rst>

The setup for that is presumably documented on this page <https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html>

## Command line

But recall that it may be possible to do much of this directly on the command line: <https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=82691>
