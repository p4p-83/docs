- Seems like there is an electrical crosstalk issue (or maybe a code bug) that's causing the rotation stepper to scramble the placement rotation of the component just before placing it :(
- I accidentally updated FFmpeg on the 30th of September and it may have degraded the performance of the stream? Not too sure, but it seems to have worsened recently. Could equally have been any of the many changes I made to the codebase. ![](Screenshot_2024-09-30_at_20.11.02.png)
- The nozzle cone currently works because it just barely depresses the nozzle tip, and the spring loaded force of the tip therefore helps to retain the cone. (The design is top-heavy and in that particular respect not exactly ideal.) This isn't quite how I envisaged it (the cone was supposed to float with low force and the edge of the cone was supposed to be flush with the tip of the nozzle) but it does work for a very different reason — even the slightest force on the tip of the nozzle causes enough displacement to be transferred through to a diminished pressure on the cone, meaning that the cone switches before the component even touches it. This arrangement does pose a risk as the nozzle tip is free to rotate within its housing, and therefore the presence of the cone could cause the nozzle tip to not rotate as much as it should or not rotate at all (particularly if the cone was too tight). This doesn't appear to be a problem at present. However, I have begun to suspect that the cone is causing a second problem — the nozzle seems to leak a little more when depressed, and this has resulted in a noticeably reduced vacuum holding power.
- Speaking of leaks, the whole head is as leaky as anything. We managed to pull a vacuum down to about 0.4 atm without the head (by drawing a vacuum in a closed vessel), but as soon as the head is connected — even if the nozzle is obstructed — we can only get down to about 0.7 atm (using a single vacuum pump as attached to the prototype).
- I didn't remake the bracket for the head (see [1004 Triaging head design issues](1004%20Triaging%20head%20design%20issues.md)).
- Probably there are more, but these are what I had top-of-mind.
