This isn't the original brief as we pitched it last year. This isn't the brief as we realised it at the start of the year, or in the middle of the year, or towards the end of the year. This is the brief as we discovered it yesterday while frantically trying to finish our poster. This is the brief that we seem to have nonconsciously been working to all along, that covers off all of the ideas we've had and considered (see [1003 Plan for poster (and report) story](1003%20Plan%20for%20poster%20(and%20report)%20story.md)), and that we can only now see with the clarity of hindsight.

Put simply, the point of this project has been to

> Profile a method to get the same top-down vantage point that a user would have with tweezers and the accuracy of a machine, using existing technology.

And in doing so we have built a machine to do just that and found many opportunities and several crippling flaws. More than that though, I'd argue we've found a systematic way of categorising and understanding our own research and any research that attempts to solve the same brief in one of the many alternative manners (see the same link above). We've developed some tools in the form of functional modules to achieve real-time control, and we've also developed somewhat tools to understand how to put submodules together into a machine architecture.

We may not have achieved what we originally set out to do when we wrote last year's pitch, and we may not have achieved the "build a working machine" goal as solidly as we hoped, but we have in a sense achieved what we could and also accomplished the research that was the necessary first step in understanding such machines naturally. Our research has very much been defined by the problem at hand, and in some sense this is as it should be.
