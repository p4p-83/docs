I got part way through drawing up the platter for my [most recent head mechanism concept](0812%20Yet%20another%20head%20mechanism%20concept.md). It's not quite done yet, but I did want to see it in person and give the belt a test fit.

I made a print of it. It fits on the shaft of the stepper. There is a small amount of play but it's not overly severe. The space in the middle isn't quite big enough for the small pulley.

Unfortunately, the belt doesn't quite fit. It feels as though there's about one tooth too many. I found [a white paper by the belt designer](https://assets.gates.com/content/dam/gates/home/knowledge-center/mectrol/whitepapers/belt-theory06sm.pdf), Gates, that provides some mathematical identities, and I've used these to try to work out a correction factor for my next print.
