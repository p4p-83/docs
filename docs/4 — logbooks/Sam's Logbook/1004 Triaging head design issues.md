## Issues to be sorted in today's reprints

- Offset top *v* pulley
- Add limit switch
- Improve printability of bushing retainer plate
- Seat the bushing retainer plate screws lower

## Issues I can sort later (but before demo day)

- Change the bias orientation of the bracket to reduce overall footprint & capture full arc of stepper nozzle mechanically
- *y* axis belt clips (w/o collision w/ platter & nozzle)
- linear rail bearing blocks hole drill pattern
- slotted holes for mounting the secondary linear rail bearing blocks
- *u*-axis stepper needs slotted shaft hole
- Raspberry Pi mounting position needs better clearance, tappable holes, clearance from rail block mounting screws
- Need mounting position for Uno
- Camera mount needs to be preserved or improved

## Issues I'm not going to address

- Inbuilt cable management
- Belt tensioners. (Keeping the various paths straight will have to suffice.)
