I was hoping to work with OpenCV directly from Julia on the grounds that it would be much easier to prototype incrementally and generally get an idea of what was going on. However, that's just not possible, so I must use either the Python or C++ interfaces.

Python would allow for iteration and prototyping in a similar way, but I'm not so keen on that route for two reasons. Firstly, I don't know Python, and I'm not using it anywhere else in the project. Secondly, I don't intend to use Python for the final implementation: it's probably not as performant, and we want this to run in real time. That leaves C++, for its ease of connection to Julia and its familiarity, but only if debugging is smooth enough. To this effect, I've seen what can be done with a basic lldb profile.

This has a few issues in that it seems to hang on certain lines in the source for no obvious reason. However, going forward I'll probably be doing dev work in situ on the Pi, and therefore I'll probably be using gdb instead, and certainly a different toolchain. This is therefore only a quick, initial experiment to see how workable C++ development will be.

I've set this up in VS Code with the following launch profile.

```json
// launch.json
{
	"version": "0.2.0",
	"configurations": [
		{
			"name": "(lldb) Launch",
			"type": "cppdbg",
			"request": "launch",
			"program": "${workspaceFolder}/build/tutorial",
			"args": ["--input=${workspaceFolder}/IMG_0363.jpeg"],
			"stopAtEntry": true,
			"cwd": "${fileDirname}",
			"environment": [],
			"externalConsole": false,
			"MIMode": "lldb"
		}
	]
}
```

This is mostly just the autogenerated profile for cppdbg with a few specifics filled in to get the test code to run.

Pulling data out for external analysis won't be as trivial as it would have been in native Julia but is doable nonetheless. If you clear the debug console, run `print vectorname` (prefixed with `-exec` when in VS Code) then lldb will print out the contents of `vectorname` along with some rather useful type information. You can then copy the output and paste it into new document and probably reformat it with find and replace.

You can probably use lldb's `print` command (among others) to get many other things out, too, if desired.
