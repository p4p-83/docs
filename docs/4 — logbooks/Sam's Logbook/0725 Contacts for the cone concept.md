Made a 3D print of it, and that worked acceptably well. This was designed for a 6 mm brass flat strip to be used to bridge the contacts. The same strip stock would be used to create four hooks by bending their ends 90Â°. The body of them would then pass through the plastic stepper mounting bracket and could be dealt with (ie soldered to) on the other side.

Still no real idea how you remove the cone once installed? (In theory, you'd have to do this reasonably regularly, assuming the nozzles are interchangeable.)

At any rate, the idea was to just go with brass on brass for now. I have brass on hand and it's pretty easy to work with. However, I would still prefer to use either gold or graphite, because those don't form non-conductive oxides. (Well, they don't form oxides, full stop.) I've just now figured out how that could work.

I would probably put a PCB on the motor mount plate, or some other thing, to which I solder right angle gold headers. These will have the same function as the brass right angle clips that I'm presently planning on installing. I would then replace the two brass strips on the cone with two [compass leads](https://www.gordonharris.co.nz/product/4597-tecnocompass-2mm-compass-leads-tube-of-4) or other artist leads. These will be sufficiently conductive. Not sure how the strength will compare, but at least they're accessible. I'll therefore have gold on graphite contact and then electrically all will be well.
