Starting to identify a few things that I'm either missing or now short on. Better make a note of these before I otherwise invariably forget some of them.

- Belt — probably good to get some spare.
- Linear rails and linear bearings, given I've not got the only linear bearings that I have well and truly stuck in my prototype parts.
- Gold plated headers.
- Graphite sticks.
- M2.6 (?) screws to secure the nozzle motor.
- Flanged radial bearings.
- Sealed jiffy box (for the vacuum reservoir).

Also a few things still to think about.

- Lighting for the cone and board.
