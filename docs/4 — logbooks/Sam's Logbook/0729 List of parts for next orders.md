Starting to identify a few things that I'm either missing or now short on. Better make a note of these before I otherwise invariably forget some of them.

- Belt — probably good to get some spare.
- Lead screw (fast — multiple starts)
- Linear rails and linear bearings, given I've not got the only linear bearings that I have well and truly stuck in my prototype parts.
- Gold plated headers.
- Graphite sticks.
- M2.5 screws to secure the nozzle motor.
- Flanged radial bearings.
- Sealed jiffy box (for the vacuum reservoir).
- [Screw in pneumatic fittings](https://mecha4makers.co.nz/product-category/pneumatic/screw-in-bulkhead-push-fit-pneumatic-fittings/) to couple into/out of the box 
- Another CM3 (with IR filter)
- Stepper motor
- [Right angle rotary vacuum coupling](https://mecha4makers.co.nz/product/rotary-push-in-l-fitting-festo-qsrl-m5-4/)
- [Pressure sensors on PCBs](https://surplustronics.co.nz/products/10847-precision-altimeter-atmospheric-pressure-bmp280-sensor-module) (at least 3)
- A few Arduinos
- A USB hub
- A new brain

Also a few things still to think about.

- Lighting for the cone and board.
